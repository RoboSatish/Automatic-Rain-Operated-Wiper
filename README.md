# Automatic-Rain-Operated-Wiper

The aim is to design and develop a control system based, electronically controlled, automotive rain operated motor called as “Automatic Rain Operated Wiper”. The project is about operating the car wiper automatically when raindrop or flow of water is sensed.

Rain operated motor consists of contact sensor circuit, control unit, wiper motor and glass frame. A fluid flow sensor is used to detect the rain or water flow. If there is any rain or flow of water on the glass, the sensor senses it and sends the control signal to the wiper motor. Wiper motor is operated and wipes the water.

By using BC 547 transistor we can easily switch the relay as the water comes in contact with the terminals. Terminals are placed at the bottom of the wiper plate. Once the contact of the water with terminals breaks then the relay gets switched off and motor stops.

Following are the advantages of the system:

1.       Fully automatic

2.       Less power consumption

3.       Operating principle is very easy.

4.       Easy to install

5.       It is possible to operate manually/automatically by proving On/Off switch
